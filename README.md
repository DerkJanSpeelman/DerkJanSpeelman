### Hello there

🔭 I’m currently working on tournament management/tracking software for the Formula 1 game series, I'm developing a space game in Godot and I'm working on a Pokémon website.
<br>🌱 I’m currently learning more about the blockchain, maths and 3d development.
<br>⚡ Fun fact: the first website I made was when I was 12yo. Visitors could order cakes and I'd bake and deliver the cakes. The profits went to a charity foundation.
