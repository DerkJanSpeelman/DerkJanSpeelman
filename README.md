### Hello there

🔭 I’m currently working on tournament management/tracking software for the Formula 1 game series.
<br>🌱 I’m currently learning more about maths and 3d development.
<br>🎂 The first website I made was when I was 12yo. Visitors could order cakes and I'd bake and deliver the cakes. The profits went to a charity foundation.
