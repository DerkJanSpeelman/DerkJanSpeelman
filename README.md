### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a space game and I'm working on tournament management/tracking software for the Formula 1 game series.
<br>ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about maths and 3d development.
<br>âš¡ Fun fact: the first website I made was when I was 12yo (Â±2007). Visitors could order cakes and I'd bake and deliver the cakes. The profits went to a charity foundation.
